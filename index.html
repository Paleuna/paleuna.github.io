		<h2> Introduction </h2>

		<div id="spacing">

			<p> Genetic Algorithms(GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithms that belong to the larger part of evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms are based on the ideas of natural selection and genetics. These are intelligent exploitation of random search provided with historical data to direct the search into the region of better performance in solution space. They are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions for optimization problems and search problems.<p>

            <p> Genetic algorithms simulate the process of natural selection which means those species who can adapt to changes in their environment are able to survive and reproduce and go to next generation. In simple words, they simulate “survival of the fittest” among individual of consecutive generation for solving a problem. Each generation consist of a population of individuals and each individual represents a point in search space and possible solution. Each individual is represented as a string of character/integer/float/bits. This string is analogous to the Chromosome. <p>

			<ul>
	  			<li>Step 1. Randomly select the starting and ending positions of several genes in a pair of chromosomes (the two chromosomes are selected for the same position).</li>
	  			<br/>
	  			<li>Step 2. Exchange the location of these two sets of genes.</li>
	  			<br/>
	  			<li>Step 3. Detect conflict, according to the exchange of two sets of genes to establish a mapping relationship. Taking S3−S7−S1 as an example, we can see that there are two genes S3 in proto-child two in the second step, when it is transformed into the gene S1 by the mapping relationship, and so on. Finally, all the conflicting genes are eliminated to ensure that the formation of a new pair of offspring genes without conflict.</li>
	  			<br/>
	  			<li>Step 4. Finally get the result.</li>

			</ul>
