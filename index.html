			<p>The artificial neural network has proved itself in many fields to solve various kinds of problems, and it is an especially powerful tool in computer vision. In our project, we take advantage of recent advance of neural networks attempting to design better semantic segmentation algorithms under adverse weather conditions</p>
			
			<h2>Semantic Segmentation</h2>		
			
			<p>
			Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves assigning a class label or category to each pixel in an image or video frame. For example, in the right picture, we label the green part as the tree class. It plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications, including self-driving cars, robotics, and mapping.</p>

			<h2>Adverse Weather </h2>	
			<p>In the context of semantic segmentation tasks, adverse weather conditions are weather conditions that can cause low visibility in environments, that is the weather condition that results in a large amount of noise in captured images or video. </p>	

			<p>the adverse weather conditions, such as rain, snow, fog, or haze, can significantly degrade the quality of the input images, making it challenging for traditional semantic segmentation algorithms to accurately identify and classify objects in the scene. This can lead to incorrect or unreliable outputs, which can have serious consequences in safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars. </p>	
			
			
			<h3> Difficulities:</h3>
			<p> The noise introduced by these type of weather has a non-linear behavior and has a strong dependency on additional variables such as distance to the camera and light of the atmosphere thus making it challenging to recover correct label from 2-D image</p>

			<h2>Motivation</h2>		
				
			<ul>
				<li>Currently, popular semantic segmentation algorithm shows competetive performance to deal with clear-weather images (as shown in below figure on the left side). </li>
				<li>However, the loss of information caused by the weather-related noise as mentioned above prevents popular segmentation algorithm form a reliable result (as shown in below figure on the right side). </li>
				<li>Real world application such as autonomous vehicles demands a robust algorithm under various weather conditions</li>

			</ul>

			<h2>Approach</h2>
			<h3>1) FIFO:</h3>

			<p> FIFO: Learning Fog-invariant Features for Foggy Scene Segmentation is a 2022 CVPR newly published paper in order to solve the segmentation problem under fog scenes. It is a decent model that show relatively good results than previously. It proposed Essentially, the main idea behind FIFO is to train a fog-detection filter (as shown in the below figure on the left side) that can detect the fog and allows the segmentation network to classify the image by utilizing the fog-invariant features.</p>

			<p> Limitation: FIFO can be very successful on light-fog images due to the presence of clear section. However, due to the intrinsic feature of the foggy-pass filter, it produces <b>non-ideal results on dense fog</b> images if fog prevails the whole image or the fog is dense(as shown in the below figure on the right side).</p>

			<h3>2) Our Model</h3>		
			<p> In order to take advantage of the foggy-pass filter, we adapt a pre-processing layer called "dark channel prior" to the pretrained filter and segmentation network of FIFO. Dark channel prior is a type of dehazing filter that uses observation that "at least one color channel has very low intensity at some pixels in most of the non-sky patches". Our expectation is that the preprocessing layer can somehow break down the fog scene to separate sections so that FIFO can have a better performance on dense fog scenes (by breaking fog, the clear section in the image can be obtained for FIFO to capture the fog-invariant feature) The structure of our model is shown as follows:</p>

			<h2> Experiment</h2>		
			<ul>
				<li> Training both FIFO and our model with 20000 iterations</li>
				<li> foggy Zurich, foggy driving, cityscape and foggy driving dense(dense fog) dataset are used for training
				</li>
				<li> Evaluate result on foggy Zurich test, foggy driving test, foggy driving dense test and cityscape lindau dataset by comparing MIoU (mean intersection over union) for FIFO and our model</li>
			</ul> 

			<h2> Result</h2>

			<h3> 1) Preprocessing Layer</h3>		

			<p> We separate the processing layers from our model and test its capacity to break down the dense fog scene into a light fog scene. As shown in the below figure, the preprocessing layer shows the competitive ability to decompose fog scenes.</p>

			<h3> 2) Visualization Results</h3>		

            <p> In the dense fog case, our model outperforms the original FIFO model. As shown in the below visualization results, our segmentation results demonstrate better performance.</p>

			<h3> 3) Quantitative Results</h3>	

			 <p> From the quantitative results, we can see that the performance of our model in dense fog (foggy driving dense) is better than FIFO. However, in the light fog case, our model shows similar or sightly worse results.</p>

			<h2> Discussion and Future Work</h2>

			<p> From previous results, we can see that although our model performed well in dense fog, it did not show surprising results in light fog, that is, its generality is still limited. One assumption of the problem is that our preprocessing can cause some distortion at the edge of the object. While in light fog or clear weather, the effect of distortion may excel the improvement of fog decomposition by the preprocessing layer. Meanwhile, we also observed that dark channel prior has difficulties tackling images with large sections of sky patches. It may change the color of the sky or even the resolution. Although our model did not robust to every scene, our experiment did show that, by making use of preprocessing layer and fog-detection filter, the segmentation algorithm can have better performance in really bad weather. Therefore, one future work may be to design a preprocessing algorithm that can detect the depth of the image and adapt the extent of fog decomposition (that is, when fog is light, perform less fog decomposition to avoid the problem of distortion accompanied by the decomposition). </p>
